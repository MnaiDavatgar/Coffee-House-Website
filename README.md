#Coffee house website

This is my first project that is a full responsive coffee shop website with six pages consist of: Home, 
Menu, Bakery, Delivery, Events and Contact us.
Each page has a specific function and design,but generally i've tried to put in them animations and particular properties for each of them. The navigation bar and footer are comun in all of the pages.

##Each section explaned
Home: Thid is the most valuable page between the others because presents the other pages and their properties to navigate the user to the aim page and provide an intresting user experience for him, in the home page i have provided different types of animations for example at the begining of the page, the picture of the header has a grayscale animation
which changes its color from gray to colorfull during 6 seconds and when the user scrolls down due to JavaScript some functions invoke and give some specific elements specific animations that appear them and fall them down. There is an specific animation which causes
some texts to being turned on to simulate the neon bulb and light that are in some cafes.

Menu: This page has been provided to show the customers who just has known that cafe and attravt them to visit the cafe via showing them the coffees and breakfasts which are being served in cafe i wanted to design this page like a wooden menu board.

Bakery: I decided to design a particular page for presenting the bakery products to costumers for making the page more dynamic i've put a menu for the products in which the user can see the informations about each cookie or cake such as the weight and price in order to see the informations, the only thing that user has to do is mouse over to the exclamation sign and see the appearance of the information card in addition,i provided  a special section for the cookie of the day which for example here i've chosen the Red Velvet cake.

Delivery: I thought if a cafe has a delivety page and a limited menu for those costumers who can't go to the cafe so i designed a three item menu and a simple ordering system in the delivery page.

Events: I thought one of the best way to attract costumers for cafe could be providing them some rewards and events so i designed a very simple web page for that and shown to the users this events in the home page to navigate them to this page.

Contact us: As having a contact page is as essencial as a home page for websites, i had to design this page for my website too so i started this page with presenting the website then, a section for showing the comments of the costumers and then a section that contains a map which shows the location of the cafe and along side of it, a section for recieving the comments of the users.
